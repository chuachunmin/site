# Automator

Automator lets you automate much of what you do on your computer. With Automator, you don’t need to know complicated programming or scripting languages to create automations—you just use any of the hundreds of [actions](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/automator/aside/glos0e92b612/2.10/mac/10.15) available in the Automator [Library](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/automator/aside/glose79f4d14/2.10/mac/10.15) to create [workflows](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/automator/aside/glos107ffd7c/2.10/mac/10.15). The actions can interact with a variety of apps and parts of macOS. A workflow can be as simple as one action or contain many actions that perform a series of complex tasks.&#x20;

Try refreshing the page. The cube is always scrambled in the same manner. Therefore, the solution to solve the puzzle can be the same.

Try typing in these keystrokes on a freshly scrambled cube and you will solve it: **`LsllddrBurDLRFddLu`**
